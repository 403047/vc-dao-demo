# Frontend environment variables for VC DAO Demo
# Copy this file to .env.local and replace the placeholder addresses after deploying.
# These must be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ so Next.js exposes them to the browser.

NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0xYourGovernanceTokenAddressHere
NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_ADDRESS=0xYourTreasuryContractAddressHere
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOVERNOR_ADDRESS=0xYourGovernorContractAddressHere

# Notes:
# - If any variable is missing, the app will fallback to hardcoded demo addresses and log a warning in the browser console.
# - Always use checksummed addresses (EIP-55). You can obtain them from your deployment scripts output.
